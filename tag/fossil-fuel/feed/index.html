										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>WHY AVOID USING OIL?!</strong></p>
<p>When we talk about the most dominant used type of energy the answer is always Oil and all its derivatives. Oil is the liquid fossil fuel that is chemically composed of carbon and hydrogen which are called hydrocarbons and other trace materials, it was formed millions of years ago when organics died and were buried without decomposing under the air effect.</p>
<p>Mainly one-third of the world’s primary energy comes from fuel oil and that’s because of its spread all over the world and the high energy density that is locked in it however the original source of energy in it is the sun as it’s stored in the dead organic matter by time while this energy released when it’s combusted with oxygen.</p>
<p>Overall, the uses of oil in daily life can’t be counted since all the primary major sectors are relying on it despite the refining criteria, for example, electric generation, transportation fuels, heating, fertilizers, solvents… etc. In addition to all these benefits, all the processes associated with oil from extraction to refining and combustion have their bad effects on the environment and contribute to both climate change and global warming; this is due to the emitted gases during these processes such as carbon dioxide, greenhouse gases and some other pollutants like Nitrogen Oxides and carbon monoxides which is toxic and harmful for human.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not only about the Atmospheric emissions, the destruction of lands during extractions, the ability to spill occurring at any moment which means damage in potentially large ecological systems, in addition to the limits of quantities of this source made scientists tried to find another efficient, clean, and renewable alternatives such as solar energy, wind energy, nuclear energy, biomass, and geothermal energy.</p>
<p>Renewable energy is the fastest-growing energy source in the US, it has increased by 42% between (2010  to 2020), however, a recorded amount of over 256 Giga Watt of renewable capacity was added globally by 2020 and according to International Renewable Energy Agency  ARENA the renewable energy and electrification alone can reduce the CO2 emissions by 75 % and renewables and energy efficiency boosted by substantial electrification can provide 90% of the necessary reduction in energy-related carbon emissions.</p>
<p>Despite the developments in the Renewable energy sector the uses percentages in buildings and industry are still low and as consequence, the emissions of CO2 continue to rise and this put us at the risk of 2.6 degrees or higher by 2050, and in order to meet the climate goals, the co2 percentages should be lower by 70% by 2050 to keep the world toward the climate plans.</p>
<p>the whole world should all work together, unite, and make rapid steps to minimize the great effects and consequences of the CO2 emissions by taking an action and concentrating on zero-carbon long-term strategies, sustainable developments, activating circular economy, and shifting investment from fossil fuel to renewables and also make it a key in infrastructure, this unity is the only way the life on earth would continue since we only have one earth.</p>
